Over this summer, I went down a mini rabbit hole on orangutans. I watched a **ton** of videos
on them, specifically a group of orphaned orangutans from the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Borneo, Indonesia. All of the orangutans had so many unique personalities
and how they interacted with each other was so fascinating to watch. Therefore, I wanted to share some facts
and videos about orangutans that I enjoyed.

## **FACTS**
- Orangutan are the largest of the great apes, sharing 97% of DNA with humans.
- In the Malay language, orangutan means "person of the forest".
- Orangutans can be found living in the lowland forests, where the species feast on mainly ripe fruits, greens, and some insects as snacks.
- They are the most solitary of all the great apes.
- They have the slowest life histories of any mammals. They are the slowest to grow up and reproduce.
- Orangutans have opposable thumbs and big toes.
- When male orangutan reach mature age, they develop large cheekpads that attract mates.
- Orangutans' arms are longer than their body when it is stretched out. When on ground, they all on all fours.
- They live in only two places in the world: Borneo and Sumatra in South East Asia.
- Each night, orangutan makes a new nest in the trees where they can sleep. Sometimes, they'll build a nest for themselves!
- For the first year of an infant's life, they will cling to their mothers and learn everything from her.
- Orangutans are extremely intelligent, as they have been observed to make tools for scratching, foraging food, and using leaves as gloves to pick up spiny fruit and branches.
