Over this summer, I went down a mini rabbit hole on orangutans. I watched a **ton** of videos
on them, specifically a group of orphaned orangutans from the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Borneo, Indonesia. All of the orangutans had so many unique personalities
and how they interacted with each other was so fascinating to watch. Therefore, I wanted to share some facts
and videos about orangutans that I enjoyed.
